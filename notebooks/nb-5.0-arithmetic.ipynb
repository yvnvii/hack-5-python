    "### Python as a calculator\n",
    "One of the simplest uses of a scientific programming language is the ability to use it as a calculator. Python has a lot of tools for doing arithmetic operations builtin to the standard library, and many extensions available through third-party packages. Here we will focus on the standard tools in Python. "

    "### Numeric types\n",
    "Numeric types are typically stored as either an `integer` or a `float`. The first is a whole number while the latter has a floating point decimal. There is little difference between the two for most purposes, but it can be important to distinguish the type for some purposes. For example, only integers can be used for indexing (selecting the nth element from a list), and integer and float types can differ in the amount of memory that they take up.\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, we must learn how to assign a numeric type to a variable. As you can see below, the use of the `int()` or `float()` specifiers are superflous in this case, since Python can figure out whether you are saving an int versus float based on whether or not there is a decimal in the value.

    "A boolean type is a simple True or False statement. This type is used when comparing objects or values to return whether or not they are the same. Binary statements of this type are *very* common in programming so expect that you will see boolean types frequently. In Python `True` and `False` have special meaning to represent the boolean values. Not `true` or `TRUE`, but `True`, with only the first letter capitalized. When it comes to booleans the case is important, since only the `True` and `False` have special meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a shortcut the integers 0 and 1 can be used in place of True and False to represent booleans. You can see this is the example below. Here use use the single `=` to assign values to variables. We then use the double `==` to ask whether to objects are the same. This operation is answered with a boolean object."

    "There are several other comparison expressions available in addition to `==`. Not all of these make sense for every type of object. For example, the `==` operator applies to any object, since we can ask whether anything is the same as anything else. But the `>` operator on the other hand is asking whether one item is greater than another. This makes sense for numerics, but not for strings. Instead, there are other operators that are often used for comparing other types of objects. Examples include the `in` operator, shown below, to ask whether an item is contained inside another one (such as a list). "
